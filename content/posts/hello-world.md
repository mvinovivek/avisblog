We are excited, elated and more anxious than ever before to launch this space to the world. With the publication of this post, we are set to begin a new aspect in our lives.

Itâ€™s been more than a year since we are together. The past year was eventful in which together we learnt a lot of things, tried our best to upgrade the family business in a small way, read some good books and most importantly evolved into better beings than before.

We celebrated our first year of togetherness last week. To make it more special, we wanted to do something new that will help us grow individually and also improve our relationship in a long way. When we thought about it, the idea of starting a blog flashed in our mind.

Zuha is an original thinker. Her ideas and way of looking at things always leave others in awe. Winnie on the other hand is good at technical writing and able to explain complex things in simple words. So we thought by combing original thoughts with simple writing, we can actually make things work out and our idea of starting a blog become concrete.

But that comes with a big question of what to write in the blog. Everyone who is into blogging can understand this. Since both of us are new into blogging, we decided we will write only about the things we know. Winnie is into running and Zuha is going to start her running journey very soon. Both of us are into reading. So we will be writing only about these things.

By doing this, we want to understand each other, help each other to learn new things, push the limits, pull the legs and we want to help others as much as possible. As Zuha is a newbie runner, we think, her learning experience and her approach towards running will help people who wants to get into running. In the Books section, we will be sharing the things we learned which will be useful at times. Also, our travel experience might help you to plan a better visit to the place.

Since both of us are not writers by profession, we are bound to make mistakes. With our work eating most of our time, we may be little inconsistent in posting new stories. But we assure you, within a short span, we will improve in all aspects.

Thank you for taking your time to read all the way here.

With tons of hope, happiness and excitement, we are now publishing this blog.

Wish us good luck : )
